    <p>This is Kirby, a character from the Nintendo game series Kirby, 
        a pink round alien who fights using his vacuuming powers to save his planet. 
        He made his debut appearance in 1992 and continues to appear in new games today.</p>
    <p>The reasons I liked this character are:
        <ul>
            <li class="pinklist">He's pink and adorable</li>
            <li>His powers are cool, he can vacuum people up as well as fly. </li>
            <li>The games are extremely fun and have been around for a long time.</li>
        </ul>
